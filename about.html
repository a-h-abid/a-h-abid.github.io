## About

I started my career as a Web Programmer back in 2012, with PHP like many others. I got interested to doing web rather than desktop as it is always were I spend my time the most. Facebooking, GitHubing, learning and reading about new techs, patterns, tutorials etc. is my daily routine. I can't imagine my life without Web. Without Web, my life feels empty.

Made most of my projects on PHP &amp; I work mostly on the Backend site as I'm bad with designing. They may seem dull according to todays standard, but I believe in time I'll be able to reach to make apps like big companies do. While I do work on PHP, I'm also looking forward to do new challenges. Trying out languages like Python, C#, Java, new artchitecture pattern like Multi-Tenancy, Micro-Service, new frontend frameworks like Angular2, React etc.

As my hobby, I like watching movies, playing video games and watching animes.
